Critical Additions (High Priority):

Cross-Timeframe Alignment - Require 3+ timeframes showing BUY signals
Volume Confirmation - Require at least 1 volume signal
Recent Loss Prevention - Blacklist symbols with 2+ recent losses
Signal Cooldown - 6-hour minimum between signals for same symbol

Strong Additions (Medium Priority):

Strong Signal Density - 5+ high-confidence signals in last hour
Market Structure - Require bullish structure confirmation
Enhanced Scalp Agreement - 66%+ agreement across short timeframes

Bonus Additions (Nice to Have):

Implementation Strategy:

Start Conservative: Enable filters 1, 2, 3, 4 first
Monitor Results: Track rejection reasons in logs
Adjust Gradually: Tune thresholds based on performance
A/B Test: Run with/without specific filters to measure impact

Expected Impact:

Entry Quality: ↑↑↑ (Much higher)
Entry Frequency: ↓↓ (Significantly lower - maybe 70% reduction)
Win Rate: ↑↑ (Should improve by 10-15%)
Profit Factor: ↑↑ (Better risk/reward)

The key insight from your system is that quality > quantity. With 700+ pattern matches at 75%+ confidence, plus validated combinations, you're already being selective. These additional filters ensure you're only entering the absolute best setups where multiple systems agree.
